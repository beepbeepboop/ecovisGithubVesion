This program contains a simple file loading functionality and creates objects as per the EcoVis design requirements.
"Driver.java" acts as the entry point to the program, and contains the initial main() function.
A "data" directory is required inside the main project folder. This directory should contain 1 ".elv" file containing elevation data, 2 ".pdb" files containing plant and species data (with "undergrowth" and "canopy" contained in the file names to differentiate them), and 1 ".spc" file for species naming data.
NOTE: The ".spc" file should alphabetically come after the ".pdb" files to prevent file reading errors (species objects need to be created first before their names can be set). This is a program functionality which will be changed at a later stage, but for now manual ordering needs to occur.
